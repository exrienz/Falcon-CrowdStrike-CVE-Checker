# Falcon CrowdStrike CVE Checker

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure that you have the following:

- Python installed (version 3.6 or higher)
- CrowdStrike API credentials (Client ID and Secret)
- Access to the Falcon CrowdStrike API

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/crowdstrike-cve-checker.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash

The script will output whether your system is vulnerable or not based on the CrowdStrike API response.
